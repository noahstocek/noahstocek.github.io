  <p>Welcome to my website. My name is Noah Stocek and I am a fourth year physics honours student
  at the University of New Brunswick. I am currently the president of the Physics and Astronomy Club
  at UNB. On this website you can read about the research that I have done so far, the research that
  I am working on, and my qualifications/ experience/personal information. This information can be found
  under the research and CV tabs respectively. Feel free to email me with any suggestions on improving
  this website, my email address can be found under "Personal Information" in the CV tab.</p>

  <h4>Undergraduate honours project in UNB's MRI lab. Supervised by Dr. Ben Newling.</h4>
  <p>Project involves measuring bulk flow propagators of flowing sample (water doped
     with copper sulfate) using the well documented DIFFTRAIN pulse sequence approach.
     In this work we are keeping our pulse durations short (on the order of hundreds
     of microseconds) and constant throughout the measurement. This short time parameter technique has been proven
     in other settings to minimize imaging artefacts associated with the time development of
     NMR signals, and we are expecting to obtain similar results for the measurement of bulk flow
     propagators. We are also planning on reorganizing the bipolar gradient switches from how
     they are traditionally applied in order to minimize the amount of work that our gradient
     coils must do, which will in turn help us ensure we are measuring the centre of k-space on each
     bipolar gradient switch. One bit of new physics that we are hoping to uncover with this work
     is a sense of the time development of bulk flow propagators. By increasing the time of our pulse
     durations we will be able to see this, and are expecting our propagators to change with these
     pulse durations.</p>

  <h4>Research assistant in UNB's MRI. Supervised by Dr. Ben Newling. </h4>
  <p>Work included writing code in visual basic on TNMR software to automate calculation of a timing
     parameter that we have called <i>Time Shift Trim</i> (TST). Due to the unavoidable self inductance in
     gradient coils, they tend to slightly resist being switched to apply a new value (a necessary function
     in all MRI experiments). Due to this, our motion encoding gradient does not cross 0 at the exact time
     that we think it does, and thus we end up inadvertantly applying our radio frequency pulse at the
     wrong time, and effectively don't measure the centre of k-space. The centre of k-space contains the
     largest signal of our entire conjugate space and by missing this we lose valuable information about our system.
     By adding this adjustable TST parameter before our RF pulse we can delay it so that we apply it at the
     exact right time and measure the things we mean to measure. The one draw back is that the TST parameter
     can be very tedious and time consuming to determine, and depends on many specific parameters of the
     experiment being done. Therefore I developped a program to determine and set this time parameter quickly
     and efficiently, making this process much easier for the experimenter. I then helped with diffusion tensor
     imaging experiments on turbulent systems in an effort to measure the time scales on which turbulent flow
     is anisotropic.</p>

  <h4>Research assistant in Biomedical Engineering lab at Dalhousie University.</h2>
  <p>Work involved mixing bone glue samples made of various polymers in an attempt to find a mixture
     with the right properties that could be successfully inserted in a broken bone to help speed up healing.
     In order to do this, I helped assemble equipment to melt and mix different polymers into a sample. These would
     then be spread on bone samples which would be glued together. Once dried we would test the strength and
     hydrophobicity of the glue.</p>
